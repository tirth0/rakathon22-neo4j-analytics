# rakathon22-neo4j-analytics frontend and whatsapp onboarding

This project is developed for Rakathon'22. We help in onboarding street vendors and small businesses through whatsapp and provide an interactive dashboard for their benefit. The aim is to use Neo4j and Content/Context Aware filtering in order to provide sales insights to the customers of our application.

Our application intends to provide a platform of popularity to small businesses and street vendors by providing their data to consumers such as Makemytrip, oyo, treebo, swiggy, zomato etc to create a synergetic relationship between the Travel/Tourism/Food MNCs with the small scale industries that drive the same.
